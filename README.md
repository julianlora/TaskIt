TaskIt is a task management platform that allows the user to create, modify and share lists of tasks. It includes features such as:
- Multi-level tasks. Any task can have its own subtasks.
- Customizable list labels to group lists of tasks by any user defined criteria such as area or status.
- Visibility options: show or hide finished tasks.
- Search bar that filters lists on screen.
- Calendar where the user can see all list's due dates.
- Sharing functionality. The Owner of a list can share it to other users selecting between the three following roles: Read only (can see but not modify the list in any way), Colaborator (can modifiy the tasks on the list but can't share or delete the list), Administrator (has all before mentioned capabilities plus the licence to share the list and modify the rol of any member). The only user capable of deleting the list is the Owner that created it, who is automatically an Administrator of it also. Any other rol member has the option to abandon the list but not delete it.
- Notifications for due dates and changes on shared lists.
