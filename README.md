# About

TaskIt is a task management platform that allows the user to create, modify and share lists of tasks. It includes features such as:
- Multi-level tasks. Any task can have its own subtasks.
- Customizable list labels to group lists of tasks by any user defined criteria such as area or status.
- Visibility options: show or hide finished tasks.
- Search bar that filters lists on screen.
- Calendar where the user can see all list's due dates.
- Sharing functionality (only premium users). The Owner of a list can share it to other users selecting between the three following roles: Read only (can see but not modify the list in any way), Colaborator (can modifiy the tasks on the list but can't share or delete the list), Administrator (has all before mentioned capabilities plus the licence to share the list and modify the role of any member). The only user capable of deleting the list is the Owner that created it, who is automatically an Administrator of it also. Any other role member has the option to abandon the list but not delete it.
- Notifications for due dates and changes on shared lists.

# Users

- Standard. As a registered user, you can make use of all functionalities except sharing your lists. However, you can still have other users share a list to you, but the role of Administrarot cannot be assigned to you, you'll be selectable only for Read-only and Colaborator roles.
- Premium. Upon selecting a plan and completing the payment (demo only) you'll be granted access to the sharing functionalities. This allows you to share a list to other users and select which one of the three roles will the shared user have. This can be modified at any given time in the list of members by any Adminstrator. When you share a list created by you (Owner), you are assigned the role of Administrator automatically.

# Roles

Roles define the relationship between a user and a list, and define which features they have access to.

- Read-only: type of member of a shared list that can only see it but not modify it in any way.
- Colaborator: type of member of a shared list that can modify its tasks in any possible way. A Colaborator cannot share or modify the role of other members.
- Administrator: type of member of a shared list that can modify the list in any way possible. An Administrator can share the list, add and delete members, assign roles and modify them.
- Owner: the role of owner is automatically granted to the creator of a list, be it a shared list or not. The Owner is the only user allowed to delete a list, and it has all the capabilities of an Administrator over a shared owned list. Any user that is not the Owner has the option to leave a shared list and stop being a member of it.
